Now that your application is [registered with Chart](/implementation/connect/create-dev-account), it's time to integrate Chart Connect into your application's frontend.
Chart Connect is the user-facing authentication flow that allows your users to securely input their tax system credentials
to establish a connection with their provider. This prerequisite step is crucial before obtaining access tokens to make API requests.

Chart Connect is configurable with the following parameters:

| Parameter      | Required      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `client_id`    | true          | Your `client_id`, a unique identifier for your application.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `redirect_uri` | redirect only | The URI your user is redirected to after successfully granting your application access to their system. This value must match one of your application's configured [redirect URIs](/implementation/connect/create-dev-account#redirect-uris). |
| `state`        | optional      | An optional value included as a query parameter in the response back to your application. This value is often used to identify a user and/or prevent cross-site request forgery.                                                              |

Chart provides two options to setup Chart Connect: [Redirect](#redirect-to-chart-connect) or [Embedded](#embedded-chart-connect).

## Implementing Chart Connect in your application

1.  **Choose your preferred flow**: Chart provides several Frontend SDKs for easy integration.
    Select the SDK that best suits your application's technology stack. Otherwise, you can use the Redirect flow.

        - [React SDK](https://github.com/getcharteditor/react-connect): If you're using React as your frontend framework, use the React SDK.
        Import the Chart Connect component and include it in your application.
        You can find examples and usage instructions in the SDK documentation or continue to follow this tutorial.

            - `npm install --save @chartapi/react-connect`
            - `yarn add @chartapi/react-connect`
        - JavaScript SDK: If you're using a different frontend framework or vanilla JavaScript,
        use the pure JavaScript SDK. Include the Chart Connect library in your application,
        either by adding a script tag to your HTML file or by importing it as a module.

            - `<script src="https://cdn.trychart.com/script.js"></script>`
                > Since Chart Connect is an iFrame that requires interactivity,
                the HTML page that is loading Chart Connect must be served from a server.
                If the page is hosted statically, Chart Connect will not work properly.

        - [Redirect Flow](#redirect-to-chart-connect): The redirect flow is helpful in instances where you do not have a user interface (such as a link in an email)
        or you prefer to redirect in order to not host the authorization experience yourself.

2.  **Configure Chart Connect**: Every flow requires you to configure Chart Connect with your unique `client_id`.
    You can find this `client_id` in your [Chart Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.trychart.com).

## Redirect to Chart Connect

In this method of integrating Chart Connect, your application redirects your user's browser to Chart Connect
hosted by Chart on `https://connect.trychart.com`. After a successful connection,
Chart Connect will redirect your user back to a URI you specified (`redirect_uri`) with a short-lived authorization `code`.

Set the `redirect_uri` parameter to the URL where users will be redirected after completing the authentication flow.
The `redirect_uri` must be set in the [Chart Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.trychart.com). Otherwise, the request will fail.

```shell
https://connect.trychart.com?
client_id=<your_client_id>
&redirect_uri=https://example.com
```

The redirect authorization flow consists of four steps:

1. **Open Chart Connect** — Your application redirects your user's browser to Chart Connect to initiate the authorization flow.
2. **Obtain consent** — Chart Connect prompts your user to log in to their tax system and grant your application access to the permissions you are requesting.
3. **Retrieve the authorization code** — If your user successfully connects and grants your application access to their system,
   Chart Connect will redirect their browser to a specified `redirect_uri` with a short-lived authorization `code`.
4. **Exchange the code for an access token** — Before sending API requests, your application will exchange the short-lived code
   for a long-lived `access_token` that represents your application's access to your user's tax system.

## Embedded Chart Connect

The Chart-provided SDK embeds the Chart Connect screen into your application.
The user will remain entirely on your application throughout the process.
When the `onSuccess` event is called by the SDK, simply pass the `code` to your internal callback endpoint as a query parameter.

> NOTE: You should not include a `redirect_uri` if using the embedded flow.
> Because the entire flow is already self-contained in your app, no redirect is necessary.

<CodeGroup>

```jsx React
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useChartConnect } from "@chartapi/react-connect";

const App = () => {
  const [code, setCode] = useState(null);

  const onSuccess = ({ code }) => setCode(code);
  const onError = ({ errorMessage }) => console.error(errorMessage);
  const onClose = () => console.log("User exited Chart Connect");

  // 1. Initialize Chart Connect
  const { open } = useChartConnect({
    clientId: "<your-client-id>",
    state: "", // optional
    onSuccess,
    onError,
    onClose,
  });

  // ...
};
```

```html JavaScript
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      const onSuccess = ({ code }) => {
        // exchange code for access token via your server
      };
      const onError = ({ errorMessage }) => {
        console.error(errorMessage);
      };
      const onClose = () => {
        console.log("Connect closed");
      };
      const connect = ChartConnect.initialize({
        clientId: "<your-client-id>",
        state: "", // optional
        onSuccess,
        onError,
        onClose,
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

</CodeGroup>

**Implement the authentication flow**: Add a button or a link in your application that triggers the Chart Connect flow.
Users will click this button or link to start the authentication process.

<CodeGroup>

```jsx React
const App = () => {
  // ...

  // 2. Display Chart Connect
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => open()}>
      Open Chart Connect
    </button>
  );
};
```

```html JavaScript
<html>
  <body>
    <button id="connect-button">Open Chart Connect</button>
    <script>
      const button = document.getElementById('connect-button');

      const connect = ChartConnect.initialize({
        ...
      });
      button.addEventListener('click', () => {
        connect.open();
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

</CodeGroup>

**Listen for events**: Chart Connect emits events that your application should listen for to handle the different stages of the authentication process.
The two most important events are `onSuccess` and `onError`.

1. `onSuccess`: This event is triggered when the user completes the authentication process.
   It returns an authorization `code` that you will use to obtain an `access_token` in the next step.
   Pass this authorization `code` securely and temporarily to the access token exchange function.
2. `onError`: This event is triggered if there's an issue during the authentication process.
   Your application should handle this error gracefully, either by displaying an error message to the user or retrying the authentication flow.
3. `onClose`: This event is triggered when a user exits the Chart Connect model, either by closing the modal or clicking outside the modal.

## Checkpoint + Next Step

<Check>
  After completing this step, you will have successfully integrated Chart
  Connect into your application's frontend. This will enable users to
  authenticate with their tax systems, providing your application with the
  necessary authorization to [obtain an access
  token](/implementation//connect/retrieve-access-token) in the next step.
