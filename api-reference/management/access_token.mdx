title: 'Get Access Token'
openapi: 'GET /auth/tax-payer/{id}/token'
---
In certain cases such as client links, you may not have access to the `access_token` created for the taxpayer.
However, all Chart endpoints returning sensitive taxpayer data require an `access_token`.
This endpoint allows you to retrieve the `access_token` using your Chart `client_id` and `client_secret`.

**Important:** This endpoint should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.
Please reach out to Chart support if you need to use this endpoint frequently.
