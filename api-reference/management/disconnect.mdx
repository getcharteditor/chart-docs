Deletion is based on both the taxpayer and provider of the `access_token` used to call this endpoint, 
and will also delete all tokens with the same taxpayer/provider pair. Other tokens for the same taxpayer, but connected to a different provider, require a separate call.

We require applications to implement the Disconnect endpoint for billing and security purposes.
